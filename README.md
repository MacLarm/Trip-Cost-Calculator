# Trip Cost Calculator

I love road trips. The problem is my car usually averages 17 MPG on the highway. There have been 
times where I traveled far enough and within short enough time-span that it was cheaper for me to
pay for a rental car that could make much better milage than to take my own car. This is an 
object-oriented program written in Swift that will help me decide if its worth it to pay for a 
rental in my future road trips.

My purpose in writing this was first to learn more about programming in Swift, and second, to keep
from having to do the math to make the decion again.

# Development Environment

This was developed in Swift using Xcode. I used the command-line tool.
There are no special libraries or other tools needed.

# Future Work

- Design Refinement. The classes have poor abstration, fidelity, and convience, I would like to redesign it.
- Better User Interface. My first idea for this is to create an interface class that handles user input and interfaces with the classes seamlessly, improving convience.
- Move the project out of the terminal. This would be a cool mobile app.
