# Trip Cost Calculator App

I love road trips. The problem is my car usually averages 17 MPG on the highway. There have been 
times where I traveled far enough and within short enough time-span that it was cheaper for me to
pay for a rental car that could make much better milage than to take my own car. This is an 
object-oriented program written in Swift that will help me decide if its worth it to pay for a 
rental in my future road trips.

My purpose in writing this was first to learn more about programming a mobile app in Swift, and second, to keep
from having to do the math to make the decion again.

# Development Environment

This was developed in Swift using Xcode. 
I used the swift UI library for the visuals.
The emulator I used is included with Xcode, but I was running my app on an Iphone 16 pro and Ios 18.1.

# Future Work

- Refine the User interface and experience. This will include refiguring some of the links to new pages and a 
few extra features, such as a delete vehicle buttom.
- Add more views. I would like to be able to track and store multiple trips and be able to select between them.
- Allow users to input stops of their trip on the map and then be able to determine the total number of miles
that the trip will include, rather than have the user put the number in themselves.
